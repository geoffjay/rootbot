# Rootly Slack Bot Notes

## What would I Improve?

- `creator` would have a model and incidents would have a relationship
- incident statuses could come from a table
- the severity list could be a list that the user could create
- the `enum` types for an incident status and severity could be a class, [eg][enum]
